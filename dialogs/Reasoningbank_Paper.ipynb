A key limitation, however, is their failure to learn from the accumulated interaction history, forcing them to discard valuable insights and repeat past errors. We propose ReasoningBank, a novel memory framework that distills generalizable reasoning strategies from an agent\\u2019s self-judged successful and failed experiences. At test time, an agent retrieves relevant memories from ReasoningBank to inform its interaction and then integrates new learnings back, enabling it to become more capable over time. Building on this powerful experience learner, we further introduce memory-aware test-time scaling (MaTTS), which accelerates and diversifies this learning process by scaling up the agent\\u2019s interaction experience. By allocating more compute to each task, the agent generates abundant, diverse experiences that provide rich contrastive signals for synthesizing higher-quality memory. The better memory in turn guides more effective scaling, establishing a powerful synergy between memory and test-time scaling. Across web browsing and software engineering benchmarks, ReasoningBank consistently outperforms existing memory mechanisms that store raw trajectories or only successful task routines, improving both effectiveness and efficiency; MaTTS further amplifies these gains. These findings establish memory-driven experience scaling as a new scaling dimension, enabling agents to self-evolve with emergent behaviors naturally arise.\\\\n\\\\n##  1 Introduction\\\\n\\\\nThe rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly accelerated the development of LLM agents (Wang et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib44); Liu et al., [2025a](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib24)), which are crucial for tackling complex real-world tasks that require multi-step interactions with environments, including web browsing (Gur et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib13)) and computer use (Yang et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib53); Xie et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib51)). As these agents are increasingly deployed in persistent, long-running roles, they naturally encounter a continuous stream of tasks throughout their lifetime. However, they largely fail to learn from their accumulated experience across tasks. By approaching each task in isolation, they are doomed to repeat past errors (Yin et al., [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib55)), discard valuable insights from related problems, and lack self-evolving capabilities that make the agent system more capable over time (Gao et al., [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib11)). This highlights the necessity of building memory-aware agent systems that could learn from their past experiences (Zhang et al., [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib62)).\\\\n\\\\nRecent efforts on agent memory have primarily focused on storing past interactions for reuse (Tang et al., [2025b](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib42); Chen et al., [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib2); Sun et al., [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib39)). While useful, these approaches are often limited to leveraging raw trajectories (Zheng et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib64); Kagaya et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib18); Kong et al., [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib19)) or common, successful routines (i.e., workflows, procedures) (Wang et al., [2025d](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib47); Fang et al., [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib9)). These approaches suffer from two fundamental drawbacks. First, they lack the ability to distill higher-level, transferable reasoning patterns. Second, by over-emphasizing successful experiences, they leave the valuable lessons from an agent\\u2019s own failures largely underexplored (Zhang et al., [2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib60)). Consequently, existing memory designs often remain limited to passive record-keeping rather than providing actionable, generalizable guidance for future decisions.\\\\n\\\\n![Refer to caption](x1.png) Figure 1: ReasoningBank induces reusable reasoning strategies, making memory items more transferrable for future use. This enables agents to continuously evolve and achieve higher accumulative success rates than the \\u201cNo Memory\\u201d baseline on the WebArena-Admin subset.\\\\n\\\\nTo bridge this gap, we propose ReasoningBank, a novel memory framework for agent systems. ReasoningBank distills and organizes memory items from both successful and failed experiences judged by the agent itself without ground-truth labels. As shown in Figure [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#S1.F1 \\\"Figure 1 \\u2023 1 Introduction \\u2023 ReasoningBank: Scaling Agent Self-Evolving with Reasoning Memory\\\"), it captures not only effective strategies from successes but also crucial preventative lessons from failures, abstracting them into a collection of actionable principles. This process operates in a closed loop: when facing a new task, the agent retrieves relevant memories from ReasoningBank to guide its actions. Afterward, the new experience is analyzed, distilled, and consolidated back into the ReasoningBank, allowing the agent to continuously evolve and improve its strategic capabilities.\\\\n\\\\nWith ReasoningBank as a strong experience learner, we study experience scaling to establish a powerful synergy between memory and test-time scaling. Instead of scaling experience through breadth by adding more tasks, we focus on scaling experience through depth by tackling each single task with more exploration. We introduce memory-aware test-time scaling (MaTTS) in both parallel and sequential settings, which generates diverse exploration to provide contrastive signals, enabling ReasoningBank to synthesize more generalizable memories. It creates a synergy between memory and test-time scaling: high-quality memory steers the scaled exploration toward more promising paths, while the rich experiences generated forge even stronger memories. This positive feedback loop positions memory-driven experience scaling as a new scaling dimension for agents.\\\\n\\\\nWe conduct extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks for web browsing (WebArena, Mind2Web) and software engineering (SWE-Bench-Verified). We demonstrate that our approaches outperform baselines in both effectiveness (up to 34.2% relative improvement, Figure [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#S4.F4 \\\"Figure 4 \\u2023 4.3 Results of MaTTS \\u2023 4 Experiments \\u2023 ReasoningBank: Scaling Agent Self-Evolving with Reasoning Memory\\\")(b)) and efficiency (16.0% less interaction steps, Table [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#S4.T1 \\\"Table 1 \\u2023 4 Experiments \\u2023 ReasoningBank: Scaling Agent Self-Evolving with Reasoning Memory\\\")). Specifically, ReasoningBank synergizes best with MaTTS, making it an essential component for memory-driven experience scaling.\\\\n\\\\nOur contributions are threefold: (1) We propose ReasoningBank, a novel memory framework that distills generalizable reasoning strategies from both successful and failed experiences, beyond prior work limited to raw trajectories or success-only routines. (2) We introduce MaTTS that creates a powerful synergy between memory and test-time scaling, establishing memory-driven experience as a new scaling dimension for agents. (3) We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our approaches not only improve effectiveness and efficiency over existing methods, but also enable agents to learn from failures and develop increasingly complex, emergent reasoning strategies over time.\\\\n\\\\n##  2 Related Work\\\\n\\\\nMemory for LLM Agents. Memory has emerged as an essential module in modern agent systems (Zhang et al., [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib62)) to enhance their performance by utilizing past information (Zhang et al., [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib62)). Existing memory systems organize and store information in various forms, including plain text (Packer et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib31)), latent knowledge embeddings (Wang et al., [2025b](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib45)) and structured graphs (Xu et al., [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib52); Chhikara et al., [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib4); Li et al., [2025b](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib22)). Beyond memory content, those methods usually involve retrieval mechanisms (e.g., semantic search) with memory management strategies (e.g., updating) (Tan et al., [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib40); Hu et al., [2025a](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib14)). More recently, with the growing development of reinforcement learning (RL) in LLM agents, RL has also been leveraged for memory management in agent systems (Yu et al., [2025a](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib56); Zhou et al., [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib67)). While most efforts primarily emphasizing personalization (Zhang et al., [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib61); Zhong et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib65)) and long-context management (Maharana et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib28); Wu et al., [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib49); Hu et al., [2025b](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib15)), this paper falls in the research line of learning from past experiences (Zhao et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib63); SU et al., [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib38)) as memory, which is a critical aspect for developing self-evolving agent systems (Gao et al., [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib11); Liang et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib23)). Different from previous works that emphasize reusing successful trajectories (Zheng et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib64); Tang et al., [2025a](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib41)) or procedural workflows (Wang et al., [2025d](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib47); Qian et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib33); Fang et al., [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib9); Liu et al., [2025b](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib25)), ReasoningBank stores high-level strategies and reasoning hints. By abstracting experiences into reusable reasoning units, ReasoningBank enables agents to generalize not only from successful cases but also by learning from failures, thereby providing richer guidance for test-time learning. Additionally, we are the first to explore memory-aware test-time scaling, where ReasoningBank synergistically work with diverse signals from abundant exploration trajectories.\\\\n\\\\nAgent Test-Time Scaling. Test-time scaling (TTS) (Snell et al., [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib37)) has demonstrated strong effectiveness and has become a widely adopted practice in end-to-end problem-solving such as coding (Li et al., [2025a](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib21); Yu et al., [2025c](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib58)) and math reasoning (Muennighoff et al., [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib30)), where methods including best-of-N (Chow et al., [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib5)), beam search (Wu et al., [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib50)), and leveraging verifiers (Setlur et al., [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib34)) are commonly employed. However, its application to multi-turn interactive scenarios, particularly agentic tasks, remains underexplored. Existing works mainly adapt the lesson learned from reasoning tasks (Zhu et al., [2025b](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib69)) and scale differe<TRUNCATED>\"\n",

    "  \"result\": \"'###  3.2 ReasoningBank\\\\n\\\\nPast raw trajectories (or experiences), while being comprehensive and original, are often too lengthy and noisy to be directly applied to the current user query. As illustrated in Figure [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#S3.F2 \\\"Figure 2 \\u2023 3.1 Problem Formulation \\u2023 3 Methodology \\u2023 ReasoningBank: Scaling Agent Self-Evolving with Reasoning Memory\\\"), ReasoningBank distills useful strategies and reasoning hints from past experiences into structured memory items, which are then stored for future reuse.\\\\n\\\\nMemory Schema. Memory items in ReasoningBank are designed and induced from past experiences as structured knowledge units that abstract away low-level execution details while preserving transferrable reasoning patterns and strategies. Each memory item specifies three components: (i) a title, which serves as a concise identifier summarizing the core strategy or reasoning pattern; (ii) a description, which provides a brief one-sentence summary of the memory item; and (iii) the content, which records the distilled reasoning steps, decision rationales, or operational insights extracted from past experiences. Together, memory items extracted are both human-interpretable and machine-usable, facilitating efficient usage and integration with agents.\\\\n\\\\nIntegration of ReasoningBank with Agents. An agent equipped with ReasoningBank can draw upon a curated pool of transferable strategies to guide decision-making. This enables the agent to recall effective insights, avoid previously observed pitfalls, and adapt more robustly to unseen queries. The integration proceeds in three steps: (i) memory retrieval, (ii) memory construction, and (iii) memory consolidation, as shown in Figure [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#S3.F2 \\\"Figure 2 \\u2023 3.1 Problem Formulation \\u2023 3 Methodology \\u2023 ReasoningBank: Scaling Agent Self-Evolving with Reasoning Memory\\\"). During memory retrieval, the agent queries ReasoningBank with the current query context to identify the top-kk relevant experiences and their corresponding memory items using embedding-based similarity search. Retrieved items are injected into the agent\\u2019s system instruction, ensuring that the decision-making is grounded with useful past experiences. When the current query task is completed, we will perform memory construction to extract new memory items. The first step is to obtain proxy signals for the correctness of completed trajectories: we adopt an LLM-as-a-judge (Gu et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib12)) to label outcomes as success or failure given the query and trajectory, without access to any ground-truth. Based on these signals, we apply different extraction strategies: successful experiences contribute validated strategies, while failed ones supply counterfactual signals and pitfalls that help sharpen guardrails. In practice, we extract multiple memory items for each trajectory/experience as detailed in Appendix [A.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#A1.SS1 \\\"A.1 Prompts Used for ReasoningBank \\u2023 Appendix A Experiment Details \\u2023 ReasoningBank: Scaling Agent Self-Evolving with Reasoning Memory\\\"). Finally, memory consolidation incorporates these items into ReasoningBank with a simple addition operation, maintaining an evolving repository of memory items. Details are in Appendix [A.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#A1.SS2 \\\"A.2 Implementation Details \\u2023 Appendix A Experiment Details \\u2023 ReasoningBank: Scaling Agent Self-Evolving with Reasoning Memory\\\"). Together, these steps form a closed-loop process: the agent leverages past experiences, constructs new memory from current tasks, and continually updates its memory, enabling sustained evolvement in test-time learning scenarios.222We deliberately keep the memory usage pipeline simple, avoiding additional complexity in retrieval or consolidation so as to highlight the contribution of ReasoningBank itself. These components, however, can be further enhanced with more sophisticated techniques, which could provide additional benefits.'\"\n",

We will first obtain correctness signals from LLM-as-a-Judge (Gu et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#bib.bib12)) using the same backbone LLMs. When the trajectory corresponds to a successful case (left panel), the instruction emphasizes analyzing why the trajectory led to success and summarizing transferable reasoning strategies. Conversely, when the trajectory represents a failed case (right panel), the instruction requires reflecting on the causes of failure and articulating lessons or preventive strategies. In both settings, the output format is constrained to at most three memory items expressed in a structured Markdown format, ensuring that the resulting insights are concise, non-redundant, and generalizable across tasks rather than tied to specific websites or queries.\\\\n\\\\n![Refer to caption](x9.png) Figure 9: System instructions for obtaining binary signals indicating success or failures of the current trajectory.\\\\n\\\\n##### LLM-as-a-Judge for Correctness Signals.\\\\n\\\\nFigure [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1#A1.F9 \\\"Figure 9 \\u2023 Memory Extraction. \\u2023 A.1 Prompts Used for ReasoningBank \\u2023 Appendix A Experiment Details \\u2023 ReasoningBank: Scaling Agent Self-Evolving with Reasoning Memory\\\") displays the instruction used for self-evaluation used to get binary signals for both successes and failures. Given the current user query, trajectory in resolving the query, final state of the website, and model output, the LLM is required to output the state of \\u201cSuccess\\u201d or \\u201cFailure\\u201d of whether the trajectory given successfully resolved the query or not.\\\\n\\\\n![Refer to caption](x10.png) Figure 10: System instructions for memory-aware test-time scaling: the left panel shows parallel scaling (comparing multiple trajectories to extract generalizable insights), while the right panel shows sequential scaling (iteratively re-checking a trajectory to refine the final answer).'\"\n",

Uses CogitareLink\\\\'s discovery-first workflow with Wikidata\\\\'s unique RDF/knowledge representation hybrid.\\\\n\\\\n## Overview\\\\n\\\\nWikidata is unique among semantic web endpoints - it uses RDF technology but has its own internal knowledge representation with special properties, service patterns, and cross-referencing mechanisms. This workflow shows how to discover what properties and entity types mean using Claude Code reasoning.\\\\n\\\\n## Core Patterns\\\\n\\\\n### 1. Property Discovery Pattern\\\\n\\\\n**Goal**: Understand what Wikidata properties (P31, P279, P352, etc.) actually mean\\\\n\\\\n**Workflow**:\\\\n```bash\\\\n# Step 1: Discover property meanings using VALUES pattern\\\\ncl_select \\\"SELECT ?prop ?propLabel ?propDescription WHERE {\\\\n  VALUES ?prop { wd:P31 wd:P279 wd:P352 }\\\\n  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \\\\'en\\\\' }\\\\n}\\\"\\\\n\\\\n# Step 2: Analyze and categorize (Claude Code reasoning)\\\\n# - P31 = \\\"instance of\\\" \\u2192 fundamental classification property\\\\n# - P279 = \\\"subclass of\\\" \\u2192 class hierarchy property  \\\\n# - P352 = \\\"UniProt protein ID\\\" \\u2192 external reference property\\\\n\\\\n# Step 3: Store semantic analysis\\\\nrdf_cache wikidata_properties --update-metadata \\\\'{\\\\n  \\\"semantic_type\\\": \\\"property_definitions\\\",\\\\n  \\\"domains\\\": [\\\"classification\\\", \\\"biology\\\"],\\\\n  \\\"purpose\\\": \\\"wikidata_property_semantics\\\",\\\\n  \\\"provides\\\": {\\\"properties\\\": 3},\\\\n  \\\"learned_patterns\\\": {\\\\n    \\\"classification_properties\\\": [\\\"P31\\\", \\\"P279\\\"],\\\\n    \\\"external_id_properties\\\": [\\\"P352\\\"],\\\\n    \\\"cross_reference_capabilities\\\": [\\\"uniprot\\\"]\\\\n  }\\\\n}\\\\'\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Key Wikidata-Specific Patterns**:\\\\n- **Always use `SERVICE wikibase:label`** for human-readable output\\\\n- **VALUES clause** for batch property queries (more efficient than individual queries)\\\\n- **External ID detection**: Properties with database names in descriptions (UniProt, PubChem, etc.)\\\\n\\\\n### 2. Entity Type Discovery Pattern\\\\n\\\\n**Goal**: Understand entity type hierarchies and domain categories\\\\n\\\\n**Workflow**:\\\\n```bash\\\\n# Step 1: Discover entity types and their relationships\\\\ncl_select \\\"SELECT ?type ?typeLabel ?typeDescription ?superclass WHERE {\\\\n  VALUES ?type { wd:Q8054 wd:Q7187 }\\\\n  OPTIONAL { ?type wdt:P279 ?superclass }\\\\n  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \\\\'en\\\\' }\\\\n}\\\"\\\\n\\\\n# Results show:\\\\n# - Q8054 = \\\"protein\\\" with multiple superclasses (biomolecule, etc.)\\\\n# - Q7187 = \\\"gene\\\" with superclasses in molecular biology domain\\\\n\\\\n# Step 2: Explore superclass meanings\\\\ncl_select \\\"SELECT ?superclass ?superclassLabel WHERE {\\\\n  VALUES ?superclass { wd:Q422649 wd:Q424689 wd:Q15712714 }\\\\n  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \\\\'en\\\\' }\\\\n}\\\"\\\\n\\\\n# Step 3: Claude Code domain inference and storage\\\\nrdf_cache biology_entity_types --update-metadata \\\\'{\\\\n  \\\"semantic_type\\\": \\\"entity_taxonomy\\\",\\\\n  \\\"domains\\\": [\\\"biology\\\", \\\"molecular_biology\\\"],\\\\n  \\\"purpose\\\": \\\"wikidata_biology_classification\\\",\\\\n  \\\"provides\\\": {\\\"entity_types\\\": 2, \\\"relationships\\\": 6},\\\\n  \\\"learned_patterns\\\": {\\\\n    \\\"biology_entities\\\": [\\\"Q8054\\\", \\\"Q7187\\\"],\\\\n    \\\"hierarchy_depth\\\": \\\"multiple_inheritance\\\",\\\\n    \\\"domain_indicators\\\": [\\\"biomolecule\\\", \\\"heredity\\\"]\\\\n  }\\\\n}\\\\'\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### 3.

I needed to find existing targets and pathway information.\\\\n\\\\n### What Worked\\\\n\\\\nStarted with service discovery using `rdf_get https://sparql.uniprot.org/sparql --cache-as uniprot_service` which took 2.3 seconds but cached 8MB of valuable metadata about UniProt\\\\'s 225B+ triples and up: vocabulary. Then used `rdf_cache uniprot_service --graph` to load the complete ontology, discovering up:Protein and up:Gene classes.\\\\n\\\\nThe breakthrough came when I switched from trying direct UniProt search to using Wikidata as a hub. `cl_search \\\"SARS-CoV-2\\\" --limit 3` succeeded in 145ms, finding Q82069695 (SARS-CoV-2) and Q87917581 (spike protein). Then `cl_describe Q87917581` gave me the P352 (UniProt ID): P0DTC2 cross-reference in 220ms.\\\\n\\\\nFinally, `cl_describe P0DTC2 --endpoint uniprot` worked perfectly in 180ms, giving me rich protein annotation, sequence data, and pathway references. The P352 cross-reference workflow proved highly effective.\\\\n\\\\n### What Failed\\\\n\\\\nMy biggest mistake was assuming UniProt would work like Wikidata\\\\'s API for text search. `cl_search \\\"spike protein\\\" --endpoint uniprot --limit 5` completely failed with an 800ms timeout and 0 results. UniProt doesn\\\\'t support generic text search - it needs specific SPARQL patterns with FILTER regex.\\\\n\\\\nThis cost me about 15 minutes of troubleshooting before I realized the fundamental difference between endpoints.\\\\n\\\\n### Key Insights\\\\n\\\\nThe \\\"hub and spoke\\\" pattern is incredibly effective for biology research: use Wikidata as the discovery hub, then follow cross-references to specialized databases. Wikidata API is about 5x faster than SPARQL endpoints for initial discovery (145ms vs 800ms timeouts).\\\\n\\\\nP352 (UniProt protein ID) is an extremely reliable bridge property - I should always look for this first in biology research. The discovery-first workflow with service description and vocabulary navigation prevented multiple failed queries that would have resulted from guessing up: prefixes incorrectly.\\\\n\\\\nCross-reference following is often more reliable and faster than trying to query domain databases directly. The time invested in service description (2.3s) pays off quickly by avoiding repeated discovery overhead.'\"\n",

    "So I would like to do a bit of thinking first. We would create a new set of tools as a new python package \"trajectoryhelper\" that helped to capture AI-human learning trajectories. The idea is that the human would be able to save interesting \"dialogs\" for instruction or create specific dialogs to illustrate-reinforce some area of expertise that could be used for in-context learning. This would be distilled using a technique similar to \"memorybank\" that can be used to guide agentic behavior.\n",
