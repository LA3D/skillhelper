    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Build `skillhelper` — a Python package that enables solveit to discover, load, and use Agent Skills (Anthropic's open standard for giving agents capabilities). Skills should also work with Claude Code via filesystem compatibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Agent Skills Standard\n",
    "\n",
    "Skills are directories with a spec-compliant structure:\n",
    "```\n",
    "skill-name/\n",
    "├── SKILL.md          # Required: YAML frontmatter + markdown instructions\n",
    "├── scripts/          # Optional: executable code\n",

    "\n",
    "Optional fields: `license`, `compatibility`, `metadata`, `allowed-tools`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Progressive disclosure**: Agents load only metadata at startup, full instructions on activation, resources on demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "## skillhelper Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discovery (multiple sources)\n",
    "1. **Entry points** — pip-installed skill packages register via `[project.entry-points.\"skillhelper.skills\"]`\n",
    "2. **Filesystem** — `~/.skills/` (user), `./skills/` (project-local)\n",
    "3. **Environment** — `SOLVEIT_SKILLS_PATH` for custom paths\n",

    "- `list_skills()` — show available skills with descriptions\n",

    "- `skill_reference(skill_name, ref_name)` — load reference docs\n",
    "- `skill_asset_path(skill_name, asset_name)` — get asset path\n",
    "- `skill_tool_info()` — returns `<available_skills>` XML for prompt injection\n",
    "\n",
    "### Claude Code Compatibility\n",
    "- `skillhelper sync` command creates symlinks from `~/.skills/` to pip-installed skill locations\n",

    "- Same skill format works in both environments\n",

    "**Key design goals based on the spec:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Progressive disclosure** — Load only metadata at startup, full instructions on activation, resources on demand\n",
    "2. **Multiple discovery sources** — Entry points, filesystem (`~/.skills/`, `./skills/`), and env vars\n",
    "3. **Claude Code compatibility** — Skills should work in both solveit and Claude Code\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proposed development order (small steps):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parse SKILL.md** — Start with the core: a function to read and parse YAML frontmatter + markdown body from a single SKILL.md file\n",
    "2. **Skill dataclass** — Simple dataclass holding parsed data + path\n",
    "3. **Discover from filesystem** — Scan directories for valid skills\n",
    "4. **Entry point discovery** — Load skills registered via pip packages\n",
    "5. **Tool functions** — `list_skills()`, `activate_skill()`, etc. for solveit integration\n",
    "6. **CLI sync command** — For Claude Code compatibility\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions for you before we start coding:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Should we look at the reference implementation in `skills-ref/` first to see how they handle SKILL.md parsing, or start fresh?\n",
